                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>As a front-end developer, I specialize in building clean, user-friendly, and performance-optimized websites that are not only visually appealing but also functional and accessible across all devices. Whether it's a business landing page, portfolio, blog, or an interactive web application, I focus on delivering designs that enhance user experience and engagement.</p>

                <p>Using React.js, I create reusable components and dynamic user interfaces that load quickly and respond smoothly. React allows me to build scalable and maintainable applications with structured code and modular design patterns. In addition, I integrate Bootstrap 5 to speed up development using its flexible grid system and modern UI components — resulting in websites that are both mobile-first and visually consistent.</p>

                <p>I follow industry best practices like semantic HTML, modular CSS, and clean JavaScript, along with tools like Git for version control and Vite or Webpack for project builds. I'm also open to using APIs, contact forms, image sliders, and other interactive features to meet unique project requirements.</p>

                <p>If you're looking for a modern, fast-loading, and professionally built website — I’d be excited to collaborate with you and turn your vision into a powerful online presence.</p>
